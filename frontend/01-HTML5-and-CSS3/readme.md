You can modify both CSS and HTML as you see fit.

## Use clasic box model
 
You can use **float** property CSS  

Note. Main problem is to provide same height for elements. 
You can explore couple of methods like:
* using **display: table**,
* combining margins and padding (with some negatives values).     

See more at this [link](https://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-equal-height-columns/).
 
## Use flex model

You can use **display:flex** combined with **flex**. 


## Use grid model (optional)
This is experimental feature of HTML5, currenlty avaiable as working draft.

It can be used in Microsoft Egde and Chrome via flags.
